# My RSS hub

I created this to keep a single source of truth for my [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS
) subscriptions to make it easier to refer to and share. Inspired by [Stu Robson's myRSS repository](https://github.com/sturobson/myRSS).

You can find the file [here](subscriptions.opml). Note that this is just an export from Flym.

## Clients I Use

- Desktop: [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/).
- Mobile: Currently trying to decide between [Flym](https://github.com/FredJul/Flym) and [Feeder](https://gitlab.com/spacecowboy/Feeder). Slightly prefer Flym at the moment.
  - Flym:
    - Pros:
      - Color schemes are easy to read content with
      - Favoriting
      - Full text retrieval can be enabled per subscription
      - Adjustable font size
    - Cons:
      - Subscriptions list is not automatically sorted alphabetically and manual sorting is very cumbersome
      - No webview functionality when visiting original link
      - Possible issue with refetching previously retrieved entries?
  - Feeder:
    - Pros:
      - Webview functionality when visiting original link
      - Can disable JavaScript when viewing original link
    - Cons:
      - Color schemes make it difficult to read content
      - No favoriting
      - No full text retrieval
