# My RSS hub

I created this to keep a single source of truth for my [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS
) subscriptions to make it easier to refer to and share. Inspired by [Stu Robson's myRSS repository](https://github.com/sturobson/myRSS).

You can find the file [here](subscriptions.opml). Note that this is just an export from Thunderbird so it has some client-specific markup in there.

## Clients I Use

- Desktop: [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/)
- Mobile: [Flym](https://github.com/FredJul/Flym)
